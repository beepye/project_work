How a School District Will Save More than $7 Million

The Mason City School District in Ohio needed to reduce costs because custodial and maintenance staff had been reduced by 21 percent due to budget cuts. Yet the floors in the schools needed attention. Even before the reduction, district personnel could only strip and wax 40 percent of approximately 750,000 square feet of vinyl composite tile school floors in the District during the summer due to equipment and staffing limitations.

Management decided to have the floors coated with Eco-HPS 100 topcoat. A durable, self-drying urethane, Eco-HPS 100 topcoat provides a light stable shine and reduces lighting needs and cleaning costs. Most important, the gloss sheen lasts twice as long as standard urethanes and that means lower chemical and labor costs.

Working in shifts, the Eco-HPS distributor crews did the job in just two months. 

The major benefit? The Eco-HPS 100 topcoat is expected to last seven to 10 years, which means it is projected to save the district an estimated $7.4 million in reduced labor costs over the first five years, not including installation costs.
